### Contribution Workflow

1. Explore the [open issues](../../issues). You can choose to work on an existing issue or create a new one to discuss your proposed changes.
2. It is advisable to discuss your plans with the team beforehand to align your contributions with our goals.
3. Fork the repository on GitHub.
4. Create a branch off the `main` branch for your work.
5. Start a new pull request and label it as `work in progress` while detailing your contributions.
6. Commit your changes in logical units and ensure each commit is signed off (`git commit -s -m "description of your changes"`).
7. Push your changes to your branch in your fork and keep your pull request updated.
8. Engage with any feedback from project maintainers.
9. Once your work is complete, remove the `work in progress` label and notify the maintainers for a review.
10. Your pull request needs approval from at least two [maintainers](MAINTAINERS).
