### Contribution Workflow

1. **Identify or Create an Issue**: Browse the [open issues](../../issues). You can either choose to work on an existing issue or create a new one to discuss your idea.
   
2. **Fork and Branch**: Fork the repository and create a branch from the `main` branch to base your work on.

3. **Develop**: Implement your changes in your branch following our coding standards.
   
4. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes, ensuring each commit is logical and well-documented. Include the `Signed-off-by` line in your commits to signify compliance with our Developer Certificate of Origin.

5. **Open a Pull Request**: Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request. Initially label it as `work in progress` to indicate that it is not yet complete.

6. **Revise**: Update your pull request with any new information and changes as you progress. Engage with feedback from project maintainers.

7. **Finalize**: Once complete, remove the `work in progress` label and notify the maintainers for a final review.

8. **Approval**: Your pull request must receive approval from at least two [maintainers](MAINTAINERS) to be merged.

### Commit Messages

Ensure your commit messages effectively communicate what changed and why:
- **Subject**: Briefly state what has changed.
- **Body**: Elaborate on why these changes were necessary.

Link the pull request to the relevant issue ID for context.

### Sign Your Work

Contributions must adhere to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1, as seen at [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/). This is a confirmation that you are authorized to submit the patch. To comply, include a "Signed-off-by" tag in each commit. This can be automated with a [Git hook](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15015894/git-add-signed-off-by-line-using-format-signoff-not-working):

```
git commit -s -m "Describe your change"
```
